## Reflections

### Getting Started with TypeScript

I explored TypeScript's basics during this module, learning about its background and benefits over JavaScript for development. I came to understand that TypeScript is a better version of JavaScript, with capabilities like static typing and other improvements that make code easier to maintain and more dependable. In order to properly use the TypeScript development environment in my upcoming projects, I also learned how to install and configure it.

### Declare Variable Types in TypeScript:

This module was especially informative and engaging for me. I learned about TypeScript's basic data types and how to declare variables using them. Exploring the enum type was new for me, as I had previously struggled to understand how it could be used in practice. Additionally, I discovered the types 'any' and 'unknown', which were useful for working with undefined data. The union and intersection types attracted my interest since they provide a flexible and convenient solution to previously remaining issues. Finally, understanding tuple typing was important for increasing clarity when working with ordered data. Overall, this module significantly improved my knowledge of data type in TypeScript and provided me with new knowledge.

### Implement interfaces in TypeScript

I found this module to be very educational. While I was previously familiar with the term "interface," I only knew it as a template for a class that must be fully implemented within the class. However, I poorly understood why it was necessary to separate it from an abstract class. This module answered all my questions and helped me realize that interfaces are not strictly limited to classes, which honestly shifted my perception.

### Develop typed functions by using TypeScript

In this module, everything was quite clear to me as I had prior knowledge from a video course that was recommended to watch before taking the basic TypeScript test. I gained a deeper understanding of Rest Parameters and Optional Parameters. Although I was already familiar with Default Arguments, I found the topic on defining function types to be particularly new and interesting.

### Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript

This module proved to be incredibly engaging and enlightening for me. It literally clarified all my doubts and gaps in understanding classes. Previously, I didn't grasp the purpose of using the static keyword, but thanks to the example with counting the number of cars, it became clear that static applies to the entire class, not to a specific instance, hence it doesn't use ‚Äòthis‚Äô. Also, I finally realized the significance of using underscores (_) in property names, as well as the distinction between accessing through private and protected accessors. It was the best explanation on this topic I've come across.

### Define generics in TypeScript

This topic was completely new to me, and the syntax with `<T>` seemed quite unusual. Perhaps it was the most challenging module for me because everything was unfamiliar. Generics is quite an intriguing concept that I've heard about in other programming languages but haven't delved into much. However, it was particularly interesting to learn about it in TypeScript because of its unique approaches to typing. From what I gathered, generics are essentially placeholders for values of a single type, but that type can vary as long as all the arguments passed to it correspond. In the module, I explored concepts such as declaring generic interfaces, both as function and class types, as well as defining generic classes. It was genuinely fascinating to see the extensive application of generics and how they genuinely simplify development. Although I haven't fully grasped the topic yet, I hope it becomes clearer with practice.

### Access external libraries from TypeScript

This module was interesting and useful. I was aware of the existence of modules and understood the principle of their operation, but I had never worked with them or created them myself before. Now it's clearer how to export modules. I was particularly surprised by the ability to export the entire module into a single variable at first, but in practice, it turned out to be very convenient. In the future, I will often need to use them in practice, so I am grateful to this module for finally starting to work with it.
