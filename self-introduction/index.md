Hello, I'm Kate Sharai, a third-year software engineering student with a passion for frontend development. 

I've always been a creative and imaginative individual, envisioning my future profession to be intertwined with this aspect of myself. However, in 2020, I stumbled upon augmented reality, where I could blend my passion for art with technology. Inspired by its possibilities, I redirected my focus to coding, pursuing a degree in software engineering.

Despite achieving excellent grades at university, I realized that my knowledge alone wasn't sufficient for securing a job. Thus, I decided to take matters into my own hands and further my education independently. Luckily, shortly after this realization, I stumbled upon RS School's Stage 1 frontend development program. Prior to this, I had no knowledge of web development, but I believe I performed relatively well as a beginner.

In the future, I aspire to work as a frontend developer and explore creative coding. This area fascinates me tremendously and I believe it could greatly benefit my projects.
